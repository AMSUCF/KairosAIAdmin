        <b>ACH 2025 Edition 2.0:</b><br>
        For the <a href="https://ach2025.ach.org/" target="_blank">2025 Association for Computers and the Humanities Conference</a>, this game has been reimagined through the lens of Digital Humanities center administration. In this new iteration, players take on the role of a DH center director navigating challenges at the intersection of computational methods and humanities scholarship engaging generative AI. The scenarios have been rewritten to reflect contemporary DH concerns: environmental impacts of GPU computing, the ethics of web scraping and data collection, AI-generated historical "discoveries," and the perpetual challenge of explaining APIs to administrators.

        <b>Kairos Edition:</b><br>
        Designed to be displayed alongside the original, this updated version was created for <i>Kairos</i> using new art assests (generated with DALL-E 3, in some cases using the previous version as reference images). The code was updated to reflect the new color palette and mouseover zones using Claude Sonnet 4.0, working in Agent mode within GitHub Copilot.

        "AI: Admin Life" was primarily authored through conversations like this one, leveraging iterative dialogues with ChatGPT to shape the game's content and flow. The game is built in P5.js, a JavaScript library designed for web art that enables elements reminiscent of Adobe Flash games. Approximately 70 iterative prompts were used in combination with testing, writing, and rewriting code to build out all elements of the game's interactions. All the images were initially generated using DALL-E, followed by refining character variants in Adobe Firefly. Changes in color keywords, particularly for hair, were used to expand the range of characters based on ChatGPT's suggestions. This approach allowed for more rapid prototyping, although the resulting code is somewhat inefficient (over 1,100 lines of JavaScript for the game itself.) All the character names and exchanges were generated, allowing the resulting game to riff on the existing discourse around generative AI and higher education. Several sections of the game code were hand-authored to fix bugs and challenges in connecting visual content with the game's structure - for instance, all the mouseover zones are "hand-coded." 
        <br><br>
        The images generated for the game's backgrounds with DALL-E used reference images from the University of Central Florida. Those were then recolored using a palette and aesthetics inspired by the early web, with a palette intentionally moving away from realism. Similarly, the images of the generated characters started with a single portrait of the designer (re-imagined as a game character), which in turn was refiltered through Adobe Firefly into different characters using the same underlying template structure. Other visual elements of the game, such as the book layout and interfaces, use P5.js's drawing features and were initially generated then heavily modified.
        <br><br>
        For Version 2.0, much of the original game was maintained, but the content was rewritten from a digital humanities perspective. The emphasis is now on the tensions between supporting creative and impactful digital work, and the very real problems raised by the tools themselves (and the companies pushing their rapid adoption in higher education). This iteration was rewritten with the input of Claude Opus 4.0, and thus still reflects the generated voice.
